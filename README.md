# The-Definition


Did i ever tell you the definition of insanity?
Insanity is doing the exact... same thing
and expecting stuff to change...
that... is... crazy...

The first time somebody told me that,
I dunno, I thought they were pulling my leg
The thing is... they were right.
And then I started seeing, everywhere I looked,
these pricks were doing the exact same thing... 
over and over and over and over again thinking 'this time is gonna be different'
